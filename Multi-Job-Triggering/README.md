# Pipeline for Trigger one job to another job for Java Code Deployment on Container

To create a Jenkins Declarative Pipeline that pulls code from GitHub, sets up the Jenkins pipeline with SCM and trigger configurations, builds with Maven, and deploys a WAR file to a Dockerized Tomcat container, you can use the following example pipeline script.

- A Jenkins pipeline is configured to trigger sequential jobs automatically.
- The pipeline triggers a second deployment job based on the successful completion of the first, ensuring streamlined deployment processes.
- Utilizes Jenkins declarative pipeline syntax for job orchestration, allowing easier visualization and management of the deployment workflow.

### Explanation of Each Step
1. Checkout Code: Pulls the latest code from the specified GitHub repository and branch.
2. Build with Maven: Builds the Java project and generates a WAR file using Maven.
3. Docker Setup:
    - Pulls the specified Tomcat Docker image.
    - Runs the container with Tomcat, mapping port 8084 for external access.
4. Deploy to Tomcat:
    - Copies the WAR file generated by Maven into the Tomcat webapps directory, where Tomcat will automatically deploy it.

#### Job A
1. Stage : Checkout Code
2. Stage : Build with Maven
3. Stage : Docker Container Setup
4. Stage : Tigger Job B for War Deploy to Tomcat Container

#### Job B
5. Stage : War Deploy to Tomcat
6. Stage : Display Container IP and Port

### Key Points
- Triggers: The githubPush() trigger ensures the pipeline runs on every push to the GitHub repository.
- Environment Variables: Simplifies management of key configurations (Git credentials, Docker image, etc.).
- Docker Commands: Manages Tomcat container setup and WAR file deployment.

### Additional Tips
- Ensure Jenkins has Docker permissions, and Docker is properly installed.
- Set up the GitHub credentials and Maven path correctly in Jenkins global settings.
- Adjust the WAR file path if different in your project setup.

### Additional Configuration
- SCM Configuration: In Jenkins, configure the projectâ€™s SCM settings to use GitHub with the specified repository URL and branch.
- Trigger Configuration: Use GitHub webhook or periodic triggers to automatically start the build upon a code push.
